**Name:** Patti Brinkmann
**Race:** Human
**Occupation:** Hunter
**Location:** [[The Pike]]
**Group/Faction:**  [[The Crimson Seal]]
**Personality:**  Affable, but she's not going to slow down for you, so keep up. Giggly, especially likes funny people.

**Notes:** Patti loves the wilds to her core. The very idea of a settlement in the middle of the wilderness was her dream. She's living her best life. She hunts and traps, but she has utmost respect for wild creatures and the circle of life, and she'll abide no disrespect of that order.

She has two hound companions, Gus (grey) and Rowdy (brown).
