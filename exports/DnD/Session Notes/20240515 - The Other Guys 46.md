*   The party sets out for the forest. [#Hammer Down](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4172) makes a Temple of the Gods spell to make a temple. [#Aturi](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4175) and [#Hammer Down](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4172) both can't enter, and it turns out it's because of divination magic on their driftglobe and sending stone.
*   In the making of the temple, [#Hammer Down](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4172) makes an idol of his maker Esgar. Under it he writes the text “Father”.
*   Hammer Down experiences a vision in which he realizes that [#Roros the Father](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=40) is his real deity and has been all along. He also sees a vision of his old owner Esgar talking with some figure before the previous Blood Twins attack.
