*   The party resumed their support of the True Goliaths in their attempt to retake the camp. They buffed up [#Dreamvigor](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4387) , [[#Threadwatcher](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4383)](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4383) , and [#Hardshot](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4386) and set out to watch the battle.
*   During the battle, the party is ambushed by other goliaths. [#Hammer Down](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4172) is thrown into the arena, but removes himself without causing a conflict.
*   It was close, but the True Goliaths were victorious. In the aftermath, [#Slystriker](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4385) kills herself in tribute to [#The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4164) .
*   [#Hardshot](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4386) gives the party a message from [#Frostseer](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4138) that [#No Mans Land](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4202) has recovered and will be opening again.
*   [#Nix](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4170) adds [#Threadwatcher](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4383) to her book.
*   (Note for Brian). The Goliaths will send the remaining heretic goliaths, [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388)  and [#Keendrifter](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4389)  to [#No Mans Land](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4202) to work off their debts to the camp.
