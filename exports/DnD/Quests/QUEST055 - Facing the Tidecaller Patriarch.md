\[[#Flynt Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156) has defeated (or cooperated with) all of his siblings and has unlocked the knowledge necessary to enter his father's undead realm and defeat him.

If any Tidecaller carves the family rune in the moon on any reflective surface (water) outside under a full moon they will be greeted by a magical door that leads them to a grotto in which an old ship lay partially buried under sand and dirt. There they'll have to fight the ghost of \[[#Herne 'Four Fingers' Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303).

When they enter the grotto:

> A large shaft of moonlight from above illuminates this cavernous grotto. With its hull partially sunken in a mucky reef lies a robust frigate with dark sails. Across the aft of the ship in worn letters reads the name “Vivia's Blade”. Upon a nearby dune rests a makeshift throne with an old partially rotting corpse resting proudly upon it.

\[[#Herne 'Four Fingers' Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303) rests upon the throne and animates as the party approaches. He asks which of his progeny has succeeded in his final task. When he sees that it's \[[#Flynt Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156) he proclaims. _“Ugh, is this what my line has been reduced to? This one?”._ Continuing he will say _“I suppose you'd want to proclaim that your presence here proves you are the strongest. All I've learned is that my line is weaker than I thought. Perhaps I should have snuffed out the lot of you as babes.”_

\[[#Herne 'Four Fingers' Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4303) will deem \[[#Flynt Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156)\](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156) unworthy of his inheritence and attack, along with his sunken army.

Upon defeating him they'll see a glow aboard the ship. A magical lockbox fused to the deck:

On the lockbox will be the numbers:

2-2, 1-11, 3-11, 5-2, 1-3, 2-1, 4-7, 5-3  
HIGH TIDE

Once they solve the riddle, the box opens revealing a key, which starts the airship.
