[#Boris the Parched](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4259) has been taking orc children into the Ellingcord Wood, and has been preparing rituals to turn them into various creatures, including gnolls, hell hounds, and an Elder Oblex.

The party will have to track very well to get to Boris without him being alerted ahead of time. If they are less successful they're likely to arrive a bit too late and have to fight a smaller early encounter.

On the way in they may encounter some followers and creations of Boris.

ENCOUNTER: 1× Deep Crow, 1× Flesh Meld, 2× Red Slaad (11,500 XP)

ENCOUNTER: 1× Elder Oblex, 2× Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, 1× Gnoll Flesh Gnawer (8,300 XP)

ENCOUNTER: 1× Molydeus (33,000 XP)

#### Aftermath

With Boris dead, the assault against the Yuan-ti city may be abandoned part-way through, depending on timeline. This will anger [#Sanguine](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4165) and [#Scarlett](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4166) and they'll likely make an attempt to strike out at the party directly. When the party is on their way back to [#The Pike](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4051) Scarlett will descend and attack them. If she truly gets in any kind of danger she'll retreat, but it will be clear that the party is now known to [#The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4164).

The Orcs will be infinitely grateful if the party is able to rescue their children, they'll be not entirely forgiven, but allowed temporary allegiance and cooperation. The Orcs will also NOT succumb to [#The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4164) rule.

#### Orc Children

[#Karfu](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4418) , [#Dura](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4419), [#Moth](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4420)

[#Gorlag](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4223) and [#Borba](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4222) are the parents of [#Karfu](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4418) and [#Dura](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4419).

#### Treasure

[#Boris the Parched](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4259) had hung on the wall near him his cloak, which is a Hell Hound Cloak, and a Prismari Primer, which [#Aturi](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4175) could potentially identify as a tome from [#Rimerra, School of Magics](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4174).

#### The Tome

Upon inspection, the tome actually appears to have been once owned by a young [#Alastair Nelson](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4101) and details a slightly contradictory account of [#The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4164). While it does appear to be true that the Twins' domination of the land was absolute, and it documents the 7 members of [#Blood Court](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4402), it does document an unknown 8th member whose status and whereabouts are unknown. Possibly a hero who fought against them. It will turn out this is [#The Watcher](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4080), and will also serve as the reason why [#The Pike](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4051) is at least kind of safe for a time.

Refugees will not want to enter The Pike however, mostly as a feeling. There is something about the power of that place that scares them.
