The party has been informed that [#No Mans Land](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4202) has been re-established and have been given an invite of sorts. The new location is along the Nelson Channel.

> You walk along the long descending dock and are met with essentially the cross-section of a 3 story tavern. With the south wall guarding against the river gusts, the north wall is completely open, allowing you to see a small bar and 2 high top tables on the main floor, and a flight of stairs that leads up to an open loft with several dining tables that looks out over the bar below. 
> 
> On the west side of the bar is a small dock suitable for row boats and not much else, and in the center of the main level is a clear floor that appears solid enough to walk on.

When they arrive [#Frostseer](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4138) will be her usual standoff-ish self and be operating it basically as if nothing happened. The bucket system remains in place. In short order the party will notice [#Keendrifter](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4389) and [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388) working here, cleaning tables and serving drinks, averting their eyes from the party in shame, but mostly looking peaceful in their work. They are atoning for their sins against the goliath camp.

#### No Man's Land Info

*   [#Zatlu](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4326) will mention that an absolutely horrendous creature calling itself [#The Accursed Voice](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4256) came upon the Yuan-ti settlement making some sort of declaration. He wasn't there so doesn't know the details. He'll get word at some point about some catastrophe back at the Yuan-ti settlement and will promptly leave to investigate what happened. The whole bar will become abuzz with rumors. The rumor is the [#Temple of Exsanguination](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4397) appeared over the Yuan-ti settlement and there are none left alive.
*   [#Swinky](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4295) was planning on chilling at [#No Mans Land](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4202), but had to find its own way when the previous location was destroyed. He tried to reach out to his “former master” in the underdark, but they appear to have moved on to someone else (it was the aboleth who is now bugging The Close Encounters).
*   [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388) has some contacts within the orc camp that he had reached out to recently regarding gaining their favour in the goliath conflict. [#Gorlag](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4223) and [#Borba](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4222) have both most recently had their children go missing and they've been issued some sort of ultimatum. Last he heard the orcs were likely going to submit to Blood Twins control. [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388) has heard of the party from the orcs and does not advise they go visit, as they'd likely be killed on sight.
*   [#Keendrifter](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4389), along with [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388) are eager to make amends. Keendrifter has no information with regards to the orcs, but he's an excellent tracker, and based on [#Swiftkiller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4388)'s descriptions gathers that the orc children were likely taken from west of Kagh Uldrogh and taken deep into the Ellingcord Wood. That's the only way they could have been so swiftly taken with so little trace.
*   [#Skean](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4411) and [#Satish](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4412) are just here to check things out and make contacts. They're largely unconcerned about [#The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4164). If asked if there's been anything weird going on in their region lately. They'll mention that themselves and some others have heard some hauntingly beautiful dirge being carried by the desert wind. Some have speculated that they may soon be granted with a visit from [#Aurelia Moonshade](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4279) (it's actually [#The Unstaunched Refrain](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4257)).
