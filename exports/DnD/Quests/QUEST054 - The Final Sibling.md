When the party is at [#The Pike](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4051) , they'll be approached by [#Juno Jellybean](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4189) quite angrily. He'll be upset at [#Flynt Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4156) for recommending an employee that has just flaked off out of nowhere. It turns out [#'Golden-Eye' Gabby Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4307) has gone missing, and worse yet one of his ships is missing. One of his crew saw it sailing off to the SSW.

[#'Handsome' Tanner Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4308) took [#'Golden-Eye' Gabby Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4307) to find out her clue, as he already had [#Abbie 'The Fox' Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4283)'s clue, and is hoping to lure Flynt to get his clue as well.

If the party wants to go after Gabbie, Juno won't take them, the only thing he'll do is loan them an old rickety boat and they can go themselves.

We can have some fun with the ship navigation. Any good ship requires the following positions: Captain, First Mate, Bosun (Repair and maintenance), and Quartermaster (navigation and seaworthiness).

### Ship Travel

*   Any issues that arise the captain needs to give the orders on what should be done. The first mate needs to delegate it to crew. Unfortunately at least 2-3 of the people will need to double as crew for such a small personnel size. The captain is not to do crew work under any circumstances.
*   We'll do a little mini-game with rounds. Each round will start with a persuasion or intimidation check by the captain. This will determine a bonus or penalty for the rest of the party. Everyone will roll perception/survival to see how well they notice problems in their area, and an athletics check for rowing and rope pulling. If a crew member notices a problem I'll DM it to them and they need to properly convey the issue to the captain. Captain gives orders, first mate re-delegates responsibilities (Rowing, pulling sails).

#### Issues/Rounds

*   Reef/rocks: The first mate can notice the rocks by patterns in the waves with their spyglass. The quartermaster can identify the clearest path around it. Not noticing the rocks or failing to avoid them will score the hull and require repairs and baling while it takes on water.
*   Fire: An old spyglass near the rear of the ship caught the sunlight and has started a fire. Quartermaster and Bosun are responsible for noticing this.
*   Swells: A fierce gale of gusting winds sweeps through, threatening to capsize the boat. Quartermaster can notice it early and the ship can prepare. All athletics checks have a higher DC or damage or on an ultimate fail, capsize.
*   Strong currents: Currents have been pulling the vessel off course to the north for a while. The quartermaster can detect this and the crew can correct course, or else they'll end up wasting a lot of time, or completely lost.
*   Morale issues: The crew are starting to question the authority of the leadership. The First Mate can notice this and alert the captain. Encouragement or punishment can be used to get them in line, or a potential mutiny is at hand.

### At the Island

When the party arrives at the island, they'll be ambushed by Tanner's ship, Ol' Leather. The cannons will fire at their small boat, providing another challenge. They can navigate to attempt evading the attacks as well as they can.

ENCOUNTER: 4× Drowned Assassin, 2× Drowned Master (14,400 XP)

Aboard the ship is Tanner's crew, then further inland Tanner will have taken Gabby. He'll have her on a tall cliff overlooking the lake, tied to a tree. He'll state that he already knows what his blade says, so all he needs to do is destroy his and take Flynt's and he'll have the treasure to himself. 

Gabby will free herself, at which point Tanner will fling his sword over the cliff. Gabby will fly/dive after it, and the fight will ensue.

ENCOUNTER: 3× Drowned Ascetic, 1× Percival de Rolo (22,100 XP)

[#'Handsome' Tanner Tidecaller](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4308)'s blade contains the final clue: “Under the light of a full moon.”

TREASURE: Starshot Pistol
