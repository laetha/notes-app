*   On the way back to [No Mans Land](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=No%20Mans%20Land), the party will witness the [Temple of Exsanguination](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=Temple%20of%20Exsanguination) in its descent upon the Yuan-ti city. Anyone in the city who submits will be allowed to join the ranks of [The Blood Twins](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=The%20Blood%20Twins), whereas anyone else is brutally slaughtered. [The Accursed Voice](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=The%20Accursed%20Voice) will have been there and the party will experience his influence even from afar. The events will lead to increased panic in the area and they're likely to encounter and possibly need to fight fleeing Yuan-ti, possibly negotiating with them instead.
*   The three Yuan-ti are [#Zania](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4417) , [#Olsha](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4415) , and [#Otillus](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4416) . They can describe hearing [#The Accursed Voice](https://dnd.bkconnor.com/tools/world/world.php?id=4256)'s commands. Some of the Yuan-ti did surrender, but some didn't and many horrible creatures came descending down upon the city, killing everyone and everything.

ENCOUNTER: 1× Ras Nsi, 1× Sekelok, 1× Yuan-ti Pit Master, 1× Yuan-ti Priest (10,400 XP)
