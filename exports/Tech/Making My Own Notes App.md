*   [x] Re-institute searching on the left bar
*   [x] Allow deleting notes and moving between folders.
*   [x] Allow image upload
*   [x] Folders show a preview of what's inside
*   [x] Make the editor view take the full width on mobile, but maybe less width on desktop?
*   [x] Button to toggle the left nav

*   [x] Cloudflare Zero Trust
*   [x] strikethrough or darken checked items on checklist, and change checkbox color
*   [x] fix title width and maybe allow wrapping, especially on mobile.

## Future Steps

*   Delete functionality with folder structures. First thought is a popup offering to delete the whole tree, or delete the parent and move the children heirarchy somewhere else.
*   maybe making internal notes open with showpanel instead of having to open a new tab
