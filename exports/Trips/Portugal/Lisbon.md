### Things to do

*    **Belem Tower** - 16th century tower on the beach, can go inside and to the top for amazing view.
*    **Sintra** - Day Trip to the western coast of Portugal.  Huge area and probably one of the biggest attractions, probably needs its own section
*    **Walking** - Just walking everywhere seems like a big suggestion
*    **Aqueduto das Águas Livres** - The elevated aqueduct that is at times 70m above the city. Can we walked on/in. While there also maybe **Parque Eduardo VII.**
*    **Lost In** - Restaurant with really great views. Close to where we're staying.
*    **Mosteiro dos Jeronimos** - Huge castle/estate, **Same trip as Bellem**.
