## House

### Food

*   Feel free to eat anything you like. The tall cabinet left of the fridge has snacks in two of the drawers, staple stuff like soup, cereal, etc are in the corner Lazy Susans.
*   The Freezer in the basement is packed with stuff. We bought the Jamaican Patties mostly for you, so go nuts. Pretty much anything in a vacuum sealed bag is also a fresh-cooked chicken/pork meal that only needs some rice or pasta put with them to be good to go.

### Misc.

#### Supplies

*   Hall bathroom vanity has all the towels, ensuite bathroom vanity has cleaning supplies, willow's shampoo, etc. And the upstairs hall closet has first aid.

#### Tech

*   For the TV in the living room just use the small remote (same kind as your dad's)for everything. Just turn it on, go to Plex, and enjoy.
*   In the basement you just need to hit the little “film clapper board” logo at the top to turn on the TV and receiver, from there use the arrows and OK button to navigate, and volume for volume. The TV is the same so just go to Plex and you're good. Power button on top to power off. If any of that seems to have not worked (sometimes happens if you let the TV fall asleep), just press the help button on the remote and follow along until everything is good again.
*   For lighting I'm gonna hopefully get you a screen on your phone that will control all the lights, and you shouldn't need to hit any switches, which can sometimes mess with things. You can shout “OK Google….” for lights, weather, whatever, but it's hit or miss sometimes.
*   Some of the lights are on a timer (plants, kitchen, porch) so don't worry if they turn on or off, and you can still turn them on or off yourself if you want.
*   Wifi password is “**garrustali**” and the network is BKConnor.
*   Thermostat is in the living room, do whatever you want.

### Willow

#### Food

*   She eats two meals a day, ½ cup per meal. All her foods are in jars on the white stand near the back door. The powdered food just needs hot water added to it. Sometimes she's weird about eating, and if that's the case throw a couple treats or just a teeny bit of cottage cheese or something else she'd like in there and she'll get to it.
*   She has felt food mats in the marked Basement cabinet that you can spread kibble in for her meal if you want.
*   Treats are in containers in the kitchen. You can give her pretty much as many as you want, especially to get her to listen. You can grab a few to do a little training session if you want or to play fetch in the yard, or “hide and seek” with a toy in the house.
*   She gets 1-2 “snacks” per day. One of them can be a “licky mat” from the basement freezer (marked  tupperware bin). Put this on the checker floor in the basement for her to eat.
*   The other treat for the day can be any of the “bar”-like treats in the jar in the tall cabinet left of the fridge. She should eat these either on any of her beds or blanket to keep the mess under control, and she should know to go there if you tell her to.
*   She has a water bowl near her food in the living room, one near the upstairs bathroom, and one near the water cooler in the basement. She'll go to them whenever on her own.

#### Walking

*   We typically do one solid walk around 8, one small walk (or play in the yard, just something to get some energy out) in the afternoon, and let her out one or two times just to pee or whatever. You can let her out while you make your lunch (for example) and she'll probably be fine.
*   She's still been really weird about going some directions. If you head right on Rossland she's not going to want to go right (north) on any of those streets (Whitburn, Cochrane), but if you can get her to, or if she follows a dog she knows, great.
*   South (across Rossland) and east (up the hill towards Brock) she'll go pretty much anywhere, she might try to lead you in a certain direction, but you can insist on getting her to go where you want.
*   Palmerston Park is straight south of us, then right on Palmerston. Shw loves it there and will probably be trying to take you there most days. You **CAN** take her there any day you want, but we only take her there on weekends.
*   Every morning at 8 (we only do Sat-Sun) there's a meeting of 4-8 dogs at Palmerston Park, they'll know Willow. She **LOVES** this and we highly recommend you take her there at least on the weekend. Weekdays they meet at the open field near the tennis courts then go for a little walk. Weekends you have to walk south along the path all the way through the park, then you'll see them at a ball diamond way at the bottom of the park.
*   When walking through Palmerston Park, and when with the dog group, you can let her off the leash. Just test her every once in a while to make sure she's still listening to you. If she isn't you can hook her back up if needed. The only place we leash her is when the group starts their walk and they go on the path through a narrow group of trees. She likes to blast through those trees and it's a mess and possibly full of ticks, so leash her up there just for that like 100 feet, then she can be off again.

#### In the House

*   All her clothes are in the drawer under the basement TV. She likes to wear shirts pretty much all day, and pajamas from 7-8PM onward.
*   Putting on clothes often calms her down, so if she's unsettled or being annoying and she doesn't have clothes on, putting clothes on might help.
*   She can roam the house freely. She likes the basement most days, and will probably sleep in the master bed with you if you let her. She's suddenly started being a bit more independent and sleeping away from us during the day at times, but we're encouraging that (**ESPECIALLY** if she goes into her crate).
*   If (god forbid) there's a thunderstorm she's gonna freak out the whole time and there's not much you can do about it. Pray it doesn't happen at night.
*   We have some blue and white towels near each door if you need to wipe her as she comes in. If she's super dirty you can toss her in the tub super fast, she doesn't mind at all.
*   There's a new white cat who comes into our backyard sometimes. I think the cat and willow want to be friends, but she'll get pretty worked up if she sees it. It should probably be fine to let her out to go see the cat, but not unsupervised.

#### Equipment

*   Leash, harness, collars, poo bags, treat pouches, etc. are all at the front door in the baskets in the closet or on the hook in the closet.
*   There's a drawer of her snacks in the cabinet to the left of the fridge.
*   Her food is on the white shelves near the back door.
*   Her clothes are in a drawer under the basement TV. All her toys and food mats are in the cupboard a couple to the left of that drawer.
